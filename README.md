# Advancing Visual Grounding with Scene Knowledge: Benchmark and Method (SK-VG)

# Introduction

A novel benchmark of Scene Knowledge-guided Visual Grounding (SK-VG), where the image content and referring expressions
are not sufficient to ground the target objects, forcing the models to have a reasoning ability on the long-form scene
knowledge.
